# IV. Explore the Dataset
In this project, I will write 08 query in Bigquery base on Google Analytics dataset
## Query 01: Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)
- SQL code
```sql
SELECT 
    FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month,
    SUM(totals.visits) AS visits,
    SUM(totals.pageviews) AS pageviews,
    SUM(totals.transactions) AS transactions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0331'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```
- Query results
