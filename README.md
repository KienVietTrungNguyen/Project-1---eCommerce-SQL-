# IV. Explore the Dataset
In this project, I will write 08 query in Bigquery base on Google Analytics dataset
# Query 01: Calculate total visit, pageview, transaction for Jan, Feb and March 2017 (order by month)
```sql
SELECT 
    FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month,
    SUM(totals.visits) AS visits,
    SUM(totals.pageviews) AS pageviews,
    SUM(totals.transactions) AS transactions
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0331'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```
| month  | visits | pageviews | transactions |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| 201701 | 64694  | 257708    | 713          |
| 201702 | 62192  | 233373    | 733          |
| 201703 | 69931  | 259522    | 993          |

March 2017 shows a significant improvement in all metrics ( visits, pageviews, and transactions) compared to January and February
## Query 02: Bounce rate per traffic source in July 2017 (Bounce_rate = num_bounce/total_visit) (order by total_visit DESC)
